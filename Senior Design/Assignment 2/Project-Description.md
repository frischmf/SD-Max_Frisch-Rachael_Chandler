## Background Description:
Plants can be difficult to take care of - they require consistent attention of some sort, each species needs to be cared for differently, and unless you are familiar with plants you may not know what it is that a plant needs to be healthy and what it is lacking towards that end. Personally, as people who have killed multiple plants and who lack in the knowledge of proper plant care, we seek a technological solution that both aids in the process of plant care and informs us of it.

## Problem Statement:
To our knowledge, there does not exist a cheap and affordable means of monitoring plant health and providing appropriate plant care in a flexible, teachable, and intelligent manner. We seek to develop a solution that makes plant care enjoyable & easy - one that informs the user of ways to improve on the care they provide for their plants and in some ways manages that care on its own for the benefit of the user.

## Current Solutions:
Currently there are a range of smartphone applications that will schedule watering times, identify plants, and plan for their growth, such as "Garden Answers", "Smartplant", and the "Gardening Companion". The shortcomings of these applications is that they require user input to function. Unless the user is consistent in entering data they are unable to assist the user in caring for plants. This is a major shortcoming, because plants need consistent care and the same inhibitions for plant care (the user) are present with or without the application. Additionally, none of these applications provide for holistic plant care, they either identify or plan. They don't identify the plant for the user, provide a tailored plan for that specific plant, and then care for the plant in any manner.

One interesting alternative is the "seeed", a "Grove Smart Plant Care Kit". This is a kit that combines an Arduino with multiple sensors and a water pump to care for the plant. It seems to be effective in administering care however it isn't user friendly - it's quite technical in appearance, it is without a companion application, and it requires complicated installation.

## Background Skills / Applicable Interests:
As a team, we are both interested in plant care and in developing an application companion to smart hardware. We are interested in learning to develop using an Arduino or Raspberry Pi - and we both have background experience in developing using Java, Python, and C++; which are technologies related to developing a smartphone application and working with either of the prior mentioned devices.

## Goals & Expectations:
We'll first approach the problem at hand by researching the basics of quality plant care. After developing a basic understanding of this and analyzing other solutions for recreatable / useful functionality, we will seek to define minor project goals & milestones that fall under our overall major goals for the project. As of right now, we expect to create at the least a means of monitoring & applying care to plants in the form of a hobbyist computer (Arduino / Raspberry Pi), accompanied by an application that holistically maps out plant care for a user with little to no knowledge of plants - including plant identification, plant status, and notifications for necessary user interaction in plant care.
