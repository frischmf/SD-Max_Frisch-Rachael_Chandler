## Co-op Work Experience
I have done all five of my co-op rotations, from January 2017 to present, at *The Cincinnati Insurance Companies* as a *IT Intern*.
I have had a lot of experience with **Java**, **SQL**, and **working with a development team**.
This summer I lead a project exploring a POC for implemeting robotic process automation into some of the processes at CIC. I do well in **project management** and **administrative tasks** necessary to make a project run smoothly.

## Project Sought
I am seeking a capstone project that is easy to apply to every day life. Something that will make a difference to people, in and outside of the technical community. In addition to helping with technical development, I would like to take on a leadership role in project management in this project.
