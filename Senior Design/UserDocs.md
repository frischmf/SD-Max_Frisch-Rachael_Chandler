## Overview

Plant Parenthood was designed with the goal of encouraging successful plant care - whether you have little to no knowledge, or you're already an avid planter, Plant Parenthood is made to help. Our solution is simple; plug your Plant Parenthood hub into your plant's pot, get set up on our mobile application, and you're good to go. 

From there on we will do our best to keep you updated on your plant's health and provide useful feedback on how to continue caring for your plant.

## Getting Started

Once you've obtained one of our Plant Parenthood hubs, place the soil moisture probe into the dirt near your plant's roots (the one that looks like an arrow!), and turn it on. 

Then, download the Plant Parenthood application from the Play Store and create an account. You will be prompted to pair the hub, just follow the directions on your device and your plant will be all set up.

## Monitoring your Plant

### Add a Plant

If you wish to add new plants to your collection and monitor their growth, click on the green plant icon from the 'Plant List' after signing in and follow the directions provided. It should show in your list once successfully paired.

### Plant List

Upon signing in to the Plant Parenthood application you will be greeted by your list of plants. From here you'll be able to see the current health of your plant, as indicated by the emoji in the lower right corner.

The different emojis signify the urgency of checking on your plant:
* :-) ... Healthy, your plant meets all of the conditions we believe it needs to be growing well.
* :-| ... Eh, your plant could be doing better and has one or two areas for improvement.
* :-( ... Sad, your plant is not doing great. You should take the time to check in on how to care for it better.
* :'( ... Oh no! Make time to check on your plant immediately, it needs some love.

### Plant Details

Selecting a plant from your list will bring you to an overview of your plant's current details. You'll be able to see if its condition is within healthy ranges for its temperature, soil moisture, evironmental humidity, and exposure to light.

***

### Plant Tips

While viewing your plant's details, you may notice that some of its measurements are bolded in red. This means that factor is an area in which you can improve your care. Click on the link below your plant's name to view relevant care tips.

***

### Historical Averages

While viewing your plant's details, you're also able to see how your plant has been doing over the last several days by selecting the clipboard in the bottom right. The current day's average and health condition for that plant will be displayed at the top, and you can then scroll through your plant's status from prior days.

## FAQ

* Where can I get one of these fancy Plant Parenthood hubs? Sign me up!

    These hubs are still in development, and were produced for the purpose of our Senior Design project. Other than the demo hub, none other exist... for now.

* I only receive one notification a day but would like to get more. How can I make that happen?

    While developing this solution we didn't want to overwhelm you with multiple notifications a day - we wanted the care taking experience to feel enjoyable, not as if you were being nagged. We may in the future implement preferences for notifications, as well as preferred constraints for a particular plant, rather than just determining what we think is healthy based on the type of plant it is.

* Plant Parenthood says my apartment is 165 degrees Fahrenheit and -40% humid... what's up with that?

    To keep Plant Parenthood affordable we've done our best to compromise between affordable sensors and effective data gathering. This is a rare problem, but it does happen... and it's always fixed by a good whack to the hub!
