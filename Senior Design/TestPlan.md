## Overview

Plant Parenthood will utilize testing that ensures basic functionality of the core services it provides. Due to the nature of the application, our user-facing activities are easily tested - we did our best to stray away from complicated interactions for the sake of simplicitity and maintenance.

Therefore, our testing will significantly focus on the successful interactions between services. These are essential to the application's functionality - if the API is unsuccessful in communicating information between the Android client and Raspberry Pi hub then the implementation we have provided will not function. It is dependant on the ability to quickly and effectively receive real time data from the various sensors we have installed to the plant.
