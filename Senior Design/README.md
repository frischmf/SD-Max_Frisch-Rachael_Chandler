## Project Abstract
Plant Parenthood is an attempt to facilitate and modernize the at-home plant care experience. Our goal is to provide education and assistance for at-home plant care in a way that is accessible, affordable, and attractive through the use of effective metrics, valuable user feedback, and an aesthetically pleasing mobile application.

## Project Description
Plants can be difficult to take care of - they require consistent attention, different species need different care, and unless you are familiar with plants you may not know what it is that a plant needs to be healthy or what is lacking in the care you provide. 
We seek to create a holistic solution to this problem, by creating an interactive system that supplements the caretaking process and provides helpful insight to improve the health of your plant. 
We aim to monitor plant health and provide the plant-owner with relevant caretaking information. This will be accomplished using a Raspberry Pi to measure different metrics related to plant health (exposure to light, rhizosphere moisture level, pH, and relative humidity), and then will be analyzed to provide the user with helpful feedback regarding plant health and advice for future care.

## User Stories & Design Diagrams
### User Stories
* As someone *new* to plant-care, **I want to receive in the moment notice of my plant's needs** so that **I can learn how to care for it better**.

* As someone *experienced* in plant-care, **I want to analyze in greater detail my plant's environment** so that **I can implement more effective care and foster greater growth**.

* As a *botanist*, **I want to monitor the overall health of my greenhouse** so that **I can address issues with specific areas of my garden**.

## Project Tasks and Timeline

### Task List
***
1. ~~Flesh out design details - Draw up design documents~~

2. ~~Identify and contact a potential advisor with experience in either programming or horticulture~~

3. ~~Identify factors that will be monitored through **Plant Parenthood**~~

4. ~~Research hardware~~
    * ~~Hub to control and monitor~~
    * ~~Monitors for each factor~~  
    * ~~Cost~~  
    * ~~Interface with a mobile application~~

5. ~~Meet with advisor to discuss idea and scope~~

6. ~~Research different types of plants~~
    * ~~Develop general categories based on needs i.e. water, sunlight, humidity, etc.~~
    * ~~Record helpful tips for each category (Ex. The plant you have chosen requires a lot of water!, Don't let this plant get too much sunlight!, etc.)~~

7. ~~Create plant database~~
    * ~~Include approximate needs for each plant/plant category~~
    * ~~Rating for each plant (Easy to care for, requires some attention, difficult to keep alive, etc.)~~

8. ~~Research efficacies of different sensors to factors we are measuring i.e. which senors monitor soil moisture/environmental humidity/sunlight exposure/etc. best?~~

9. ~~Obtain hardware~~
    * ~~Raspberry Pi~~
    * ~~Environmental monitors~~

10. ~~Research mobile application platforms/languages~~

11. ~~Obtain any necessary software or licenses~~

12. ~~Build mobile application~~
    * ~~Android~~

13. ~~Program hardware and sensors~~

14. ~~Get mobile application and hardware working together to monitor conditions~~

15. ~~Develop tests for different types of plants and conditions~~
    * ~~Low/high moisture plants~~
    * ~~More/less sunlight needed plants~~

16. ~~Evaluate functionality~~

17. ~~Tweak project for better results~~

18. ~~Retest (Repeat 15, 16, 17 as needed)~~

19. ~~Write up report/presentation~~

20. Graduate - soon!
